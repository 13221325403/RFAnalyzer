=======================

This is the repository of the RF Analyzer app for Android. It can be used
to view a FFT plot and a waterfall plot of the frequency spectrum
received by a HackRF.

--------------------
* Browse the spectrum by scrolling horizontally
* Zoom in and out, both horizontally and vertically
* Adjust the sample rate and center frequency to match the current view of the screen by double tapping
* Auto scale the vertical axis
* Jump directly to a frequency
* Adjust the gain settings of the HackRF
* Select a pre-recorded file as source instead of a real HackRF
* Change the FFT size
* Setting the frame rate either to a fixed value or to automatic control
* Activate logging and showing the log file


Testet Devices
--------------

RF Analyzer uses the hackrf_android libaray. Have a look at the corresponding
repository for information about supported devices:
[https://github.com/demantz/hackrf_android](https://github.com/demantz/hackrf_android)

Known Issues
------------
* still needs a lot of optimazation to reduce CPU load and achieve higher frame rates
* not much testing so far


Installation / Usage
--------------------
The app project in this repository was generated by Android Studio.

The RFAnalyzer.apk file is also in this repository so that it can be used without 
building it yourself. But it won't be synched to the latest code base all the time.

A basic how-to-start can be found on this blog post:
