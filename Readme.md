RF Analyzer for Android
=======================

This is the repository of the RF Analyzer app for Android. It can be used
to view a FFT plot and a waterfall plot of the frequency spectrum
received by a HackRF. The new version can also demodulate audio from
AM and FM signals!

Testet Devices
--------------

RF Analyzer uses the hackrf_android libaray. Have a look at the corresponding
repository for information about supported devices:
[https://github.com/demantz/hackrf_android](https://github.com/demantz/hackrf_android)

Known Issues
------------
* Strong aliasing images in some rare situations. Must be something wrong with the
  baseband filter width. But it's hard to reproduce.


Installation / Usage
--------------------
The app project in this repository was generated by Android Studio.
* Create a new empty project with Android Studio. 
* Delete the 'app' directory in the project directory.
* Copy the repository into the project directory:
  git clone git://github.com/demantz/RFAnalyzer app

The RFAnalyzer.apk file is also in this repository so that it can be used without 
building it yourself. But it won't be synched to the latest code base all the time.

A basic how-to-start can be found on this blog post:
